## Kaggle Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) from various Kaggle projects I have worked on. Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning competitions, and these notebooks showcase my data analysis, data preprocessing, machine learning models, and other data science techniques.

## Contents
The repository is organized into folders based on the Kaggle competition or project. Each folder contains the following:

notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook file for the specific project.
data/: A subfolder that may contain the datasets used in the notebook (if allowed by Kaggle's competition rules).
README.md: A README file providing a brief overview of the project, the problem statement, and the techniques used.

### Usage
Feel free to explore the notebooks to learn more about the data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models used in these projects. If you are interested in running any of the notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed along with the required libraries (specified in each notebook). Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary datasets (if any) in the respective data/ folders.
