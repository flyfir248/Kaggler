Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning competitions, and these notebooks showcase my data analysis, data preprocessing, machine learning models, and other data science techniques.

## Contents
notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook file for the specific project.
data/: A subfolder that may contain the datasets used in the notebook (if allowed by Kaggle's competition rules).
README.md: A README file providing a brief overview of the project, the problem statement, and the techniques used.

## Kaggle Competitions and Projects
This is a collection of all the Kaggle projects  completed

### Usage
